<!-- inline styling: you can use ngStyle to apply styles directly to an element
based on component properties. This allows you to dynamically change the
appearance of the button based on the input color property. -->
<!-- declaration of event: in this case onClick() -->
<button
  [ngStyle]="{ 'background-color': color }"
  class="btn"
  (click)="onClick()"
>
  {{ text }}
</button>
